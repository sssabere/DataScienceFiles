This file will gather all the material covered in the assignments and exams:
Assignment 1-reading a file and parse it with cvd;
            -probability and distribution problems,thresholds;
            -empirical analysis;
Assignment 2-Markov chain analysis,irreducibility,stationary distribution;
            -Multi dimension constrained optimization(log);
            -Maximum Likelihood estimation using derivatives;
            -Random Variable generation and Transformation,Accept reject Sampler(algorithm 1 in tfds,it considers hull-Dobell theorem);
Assignment 3-Reading a file and parse it with cvd but more advanced;
            -Training a dataframe through a model;
            -Training a model with splits;
            -Implementation of a final loss function;

            -Training a model, splitting, count vectorizer, logistic regression, pipeline;
            -precision and recall of a class;
            -defining a cost function,optimal threshold of the cost;
            -confidence interval using Hoeffdings inequality;
            -same thing but with Bennets inequality;
